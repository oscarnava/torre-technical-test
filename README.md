# Torre Technical Test

## Instructions

Please show us your strengths/skills by building anything you'd like using data from Torre.
The goal is for us to get an idea of your skills/strengths in the areas of web development, software architecture, algorithms, innovation, strategic thinking, autonomy, learning, attention to detail, and communication. If you join our team, you'll be working on the full stack. As such, we'll be evaluating your potential in both front and back end development.

- [ ] You can invest as much time as you'd like.
- [ ] Please log your progress.
- [ ] You have 24 hours to complete it.

Your deliverables are:
- A link for us to test what you built.
- Your progress log.
- A way for us to review your code through a control version system (for example, Github) where we can review your incremental progress.
- Anything else you'd like to share with us.

Please submit your deliverables in this channel.
